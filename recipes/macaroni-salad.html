    <p>This recipe is easily multiplied for a crowd. Everyone in my family asks me to bring this to our functions. </p>
    <p>I even make it for weddings. Sometimes I use a mixture of different kinds of pasta, especially if </p>
    <p>I only have a little of this kind or that. Depending on what type of macaroni used, more dressing may be required. </p>
    <p>The recipe calls for red onion, but sweet onion is great, too.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Drain; rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, combine drained pasta, celery, onion, olives, sweet pickles, carrots, green pepper, and chopped eggs. Stir in dressing, and mix well. Refrigerate before serving.</li>
